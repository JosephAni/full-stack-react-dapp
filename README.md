# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case which contains a sample contract, a test for that contract, a script to deploy the sample contract and an example of a task implementation.
The sample contract shows an example of how to write and deploy a basic Ethereum smart contract while the test checks the various deployed functions of that contract.
The script makes it easy to deploy the contract to an Ethereum network with just a few lines of code. The task provides an example of how to take advantage of the tasks built into Hardhat, in this case just listing the available accounts in the network.
In summary, this project provides all the necessary components for a no-hassle way of deploying a smart contract to an Ethereum network.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
